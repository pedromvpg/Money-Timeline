It’s about 93 million miles (150 million kilometers) from Earth and it’s our solar system’s only star. Without the Sun’s energy, life as we know it could not exist on our home planet.\n\nFrom our vantage point on Earth, the Sun may appear like an unchanging source of light and heat in the sky. But the Sun is a dynamic star, constantly changing and sending energy out into space. The science of studying the Sun and its influence throughout the solar system is called heliophysics.",

   "description": "Any water on Earth during the latter part of its accretion would have been disrupted by the Moon-forming impact (~4.5 billion years ago), which likely vaporized much of Earth's crust and upper mantle and created a rock-vapor atmosphere around the young planet. The rock vapor would have condensed within two thousand years, leaving behind hot volatiles which probably resulted in a majority carbon dioxide atmosphere with hydrogen and water vapor. Afterwards, liquid water oceans may have existed despite the surface temperature of 230 °C (446 °F) due to the increased atmospheric pressure of the CO2 atmosphere. As cooling continued, most CO2 was removed from the atmosphere by subduction and dissolution in ocean water, but levels oscillated wildly as new surface and mantle cycles appeared.",

Shallow ripples caused by heating run across a piece of rock excavated in a Spanish cave. \nThis and other finds indicate that an undetermined Homo species lit small fires in the cave around 800,000 years ago, researchers say.  Each square on the measuring stick covers 1 centimeter.",

   "description": "The Lebombo bone is a bone tool made of a baboon fibula with incised markings discovered in the Lebombo Mountains located between South Africa and Eswatini. Changes in the section of the notches indicate the use of different cutting edges, which the bone's discoverer, Peter Beaumont, views as evidence for their having been made, like other markings found all over the world, during participation in rituals.\nThe bone is between 44,200 and 43,000 years old, according to 24 radiocarbon datings. This is far older than the Ishango bone with which it is sometimes confused. Other notched bones are 80,000 years old but it is unclear if the notches are merely decorative or if they bear a functional meaning.\nAccording to The Universal Book of Mathematics the Lebombo bone's 29 notches suggest \"it may have been used as a lunar phase counter, in which case African women may have been the first mathematicians, because keeping track of menstrual cycles requires a lunar calendar\". However, the bone is clearly broken at one end, so the 29 notches may or may not be the total number. In the cases of other notched bones since found globally, there has been no consistent notch tally, many being in the 1–10 range.",

Initially, the metal used was the naturally occurring electrum found in river beds and consisting of approximately 80-90% gold and 10-20% silver. However, the early Lydian coins had a much lower gold content, of around 55%, suggesting that the Lydian metallurgists were able to separate silver from electrum and then add extra silver to the coinage alloy before casting the coins.\nThe earliest coins, like these shown above, date from the late seventh century BCE, i.e., 600-625 BCE. The only markings consist of the punch marks on one side. By the middle of the sixth century BCE, the Lydians were producing pure gold coins such as the renowned Croesus Stater with a design on one side and punch marks on the other.",

The top of his crown displays a crescent, the symbol of the Sassanid Empire. The reverse shows two priests around a fire altar: the Sassanids were adherents of Zoroastrianism, a religion with temples in which sacred fires were fostered.",

These coins replaced the traditional Roman coins aureus, denarius and sesterce. As half solidus, Constantine had the semissis struck. Semisses mostly bore the emperor's busts on the obverse – on this coin it is Phocas (602-610) –, while the reverse typically illustrated a winged Victoria.",

Wooden sticks were used in the middle ages and notches were cut (‘talea’ in Latin) indicating a sum owed to the Exchequer by sheriffs and other officials due to collect taxes and other money for the crown, and details written down each side. The stick was then sliced in two with the debtor being given the larger part (the foil) and the Exchequer keeping the smaller (known as the counterfoil). When the debt was repaid to the Exchequer, the two unique parts were married up to prove that the sum had been handed over.",

   "description": "Equivalent to 1,000 copper coins. Made in mulberry bark paper, the text warns about penalties for counterfeiters. This early paper money was in use when Marco Polo visited Kublai Khan in the 13th century. The note, called a kua, is the equivalent of 100 coins and dates from the Ming Dynasty.\nThis note was issued under the Ming dynasty. After seizing power from the Mongol rulers of China in 1368, the Ming rulers tried to reinstate bronze coins. However, there was not enough metal available for this, and paper money, made of mulberry bark, was produced from 1375. Paper money continued to be issued throughout the Ming dynasty, but inflation quickly eroded its value. The effect of inflation was so devastating that paper money was regarded with suspicion for many years. It was not until the 1850s that a Chinese emperor dared to issue paper money again.The Chinese writing along the top of this Ming note reads 'Da ming tong xing bao chao' from right to left. This translates as 'Great Ming Circulating Treasure Note'. Below this, the denomination is written in two characters 'yi guan' ('one string'). Beneath the denomination is a picture of a string of 1000 coins, arranged in ten groups of one hundred coins. Beneath this are the instructions for use and a threat to punish forgers.",

However, this did not stop the hyperinflation, and prices continued spiraling out of control, with ever-higher denominations introduced. The denominations milpengő (one million pengő) and b.-pengő (pronunciation: bilpengő, one trillion (1000000000000) P) were used to simplify calculations, cut down the number of zeros and enable the reuse of banknote designs with only the colour and denomination name changed.\nThe hyperinflation was so out of control that at one stage it took about 15 hours for prices to double and about four days for the pengő to lose 90% of its original value",

On September 12, he presented his findings to company's management, which included Mark Shepherd. He showed them a piece of germanium with an oscilloscope attached, pressed a switch, and the oscilloscope showed a continuous sine wave, proving that his integrated circuit worked, and thus that he had solved the problem.

   "description": "Long-Term Capital Management did business with nearly every important person on Wall Street. Indeed, much of LTCM's capital was composed of funds from the same financial professionals with whom it traded. As LTCM teetered, Wall Street feared that Long-Term's failure could cause a chain reaction in numerous markets, causing catastrophic losses throughout the financial system.\nAfter LTCM failed to raise more money on its own, it became clear it was running out of options. On September 23, 1998, Goldman Sachs, AIG, and Berkshire Hathaway offered then to buy out the fund's partners for $250 million, to inject $3.75 billion and to operate LTCM within Goldman's own trading division. The offer of $250 million was stunningly low to LTCM's partners because at the start of the year their firm had been worth $4.7 billion. Warren Buffett gave Meriwether less than one hour to accept the deal; the time lapsed before a deal could be worked out.[30]\nSeeing no options left, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York organized a bailout of $3.625 billion by the major creditors to avoid a wider collapse in the financial markets. The principal negotiator for LTCM was general counsel James G. Rickards.",

On November 9, 2000, Pets.com, a much-hyped company that had backing from Amazon.com, went out of business only nine months after completing its IPO. By that time, most Internet stocks had declined in value by 75% from their highs, wiping out $1.755 trillion in value.[54] In January 2001, just three dot-com companies bought advertising spots during Super Bowl XXXV. Without question September 11 attacks later accelerated the stock-market drop. Investor confidence was further eroded by several accounting scandals and the resulting bankruptcies, including the Enron scandal in October 2001, the WorldCom scandal in June 2002, and the Adelphia Communications Corporation scandal in July 2002.",

Further purchases were halted as the economy started to improve, but resumed in August 2010 when the Fed decided the economy was not growing robustly. After the halt in June, holdings started falling naturally as debt matured and were projected to fall to $1.7 trillion by 2012. The Fed's revised goal became to keep holdings at $2.054 trillion. To maintain that level, the Fed bought $30 billion in two- to ten-year Treasury notes every month.",
