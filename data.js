It’s about 93 million miles (150 million kilometers) from Earth and it’s our solar system’s only star. Without the Sun’s energy, life as we know it could not exist on our home planet.\n\nFrom our vantage point on Earth, the Sun may appear like an unchanging source of light and heat in the sky. But the Sun is a dynamic star, constantly changing and sending energy out into space. The science of studying the Sun and its influence throughout the solar system is called heliophysics.",

   "description": "Any water on Earth during the latter part of its accretion would have been disrupted by the Moon-forming impact (~4.5 billion years ago), which likely vaporized much of Earth's crust and upper mantle and created a rock-vapor atmosphere around the young planet. The rock vapor would have condensed within two thousand years, leaving behind hot volatiles which probably resulted in a majority carbon dioxide atmosphere with hydrogen and water vapor. Afterwards, liquid water oceans may have existed despite the surface temperature of 230 °C (446 °F) due to the increased atmospheric pressure of the CO2 atmosphere. As cooling continued, most CO2 was removed from the atmosphere by subduction and dissolution in ocean water, but levels oscillated wildly as new surface and mantle cycles appeared.",

   "description": "The Lebombo bone is a bone tool made of a baboon fibula with incised markings discovered in the Lebombo Mountains located between South Africa and Eswatini. Changes in the section of the notches indicate the use of different cutting edges, which the bone's discoverer, Peter Beaumont, views as evidence for their having been made, like other markings found all over the world, during participation in rituals.\nThe bone is between 44,200 and 43,000 years old, according to 24 radiocarbon datings. This is far older than the Ishango bone with which it is sometimes confused. Other notched bones are 80,000 years old but it is unclear if the notches are merely decorative or if they bear a functional meaning.\nAccording to The Universal Book of Mathematics the Lebombo bone's 29 notches suggest \"it may have been used as a lunar phase counter, in which case African women may have been the first mathematicians, because keeping track of menstrual cycles requires a lunar calendar\". However, the bone is clearly broken at one end, so the 29 notches may or may not be the total number. In the cases of other notched bones since found globally, there has been no consistent notch tally, many being in the 1–10 range.",

Initially, the metal used was the naturally occurring electrum found in river beds and consisting of approximately 80-90% gold and 10-20% silver. However, the early Lydian coins had a much lower gold content, of around 55%, suggesting that the Lydian metallurgists were able to separate silver from electrum and then add extra silver to the coinage alloy before casting the coins.\nThe earliest coins, like these shown above, date from the late seventh century BCE, i.e., 600-625 BCE. The only markings consist of the punch marks on one side. By the middle of the sixth century BCE, the Lydians were producing pure gold coins such as the renowned Croesus Stater with a design on one side and punch marks on the other.",

   "description": "The spread of Greek-style coinage shows many interesting features of cultural admixture. At Tarsus, for instance, several Persian satraps during the 4th century minted coins for their military expenses. One of them was Mazaios (361-334 BC), the minting prerogative of this stater. While on Greek coins Zeus sits on the obverse, it is the god of fertility Baal Tars on this stater. This is suggested by the Aramaic legend \"baal tarz\" (Baal of Tarsos). The vine and the corn also allude to a vegetation deity. The eagle, on the other hand, is a typical attribute of Zeus. The reverse depicts a lion slaying a bull. This motif went back to an astrological symbolism and was common in Persian art.",

   "description": "Coins were minted in England from about 650 AD; from about 900 they were struck regularly and in bigger quantities in diverse mints all over England. At that time, the Royal Mint in London was established, where British coins have been issued ever since. This sceat was probably struck in Kent and dates from the second half of the 7th century. At that time, a large series of sceattas was minted in England; they all show a bust with an aureole on the obverse. The reverse depicts a square standard and the letters VOT XX. For one and a half centuries, such coins were the main currency of the Anglo-Saxons and their neighbors across the English Channel – until the 8th century, when they were displaced by a new coin type: the penny.",

Wooden sticks were used in the middle ages and notches were cut (‘talea’ in Latin) indicating a sum owed to the Exchequer by sheriffs and other officials due to collect taxes and other money for the crown, and details written down each side. The stick was then sliced in two with the debtor being given the larger part (the foil) and the Exchequer keeping the smaller (known as the counterfoil). When the debt was repaid to the Exchequer, the two unique parts were married up to prove that the sum had been handed over.",

After seizing power from the Mongol rulers of China in 1368, the Ming rulers tried to reinstate bronze coins. However, there was not enough metal available for this, and paper money, made of mulberry bark, was produced from 1375. Paper money continued to be issued throughout the Ming dynasty, but inflation quickly eroded its value. The effect of inflation was so devastating that paper money was regarded with suspicion for many years. It was not until the 1850s that a Chinese emperor dared to issue paper money again.The Chinese writing along the top of this Ming note reads 'Da ming tong xing bao chao' from right to left. This translates as 'Great Ming Circulating Treasure Note'. Below this, the denomination is written in two characters 'yi guan' ('one string').

Overspending by Henry VIII to pay for his lavish lifestyle and to fund foreign wars with France and Scotland are cited as reasons for the policy's introduction. The main aim of the policy was to increase revenue for the Crown at the cost of taxpayers through savings in currency production with less bullion being required to mint new coins.",

The fallout of this was the largest Linden Dollar bank in SL, Ginko Financial, which had its Linden Dollar ATMs in most major gaming regions, saw its reserves drained completely within hours, and was never able to catch up with Linden Dollar withdrawal requests, which eventually amounted to L$55 million out of deposits of L$180 million.

Further purchases were halted as the economy started to improve, but resumed in August 2010 when the Fed decided the economy was not growing robustly.

   "description": "The Coldcard can be used by itself without the need to connect to a computer. This means that you can use the Mk3 in an air gapped fashion, which can be a huge plus in the eyes of a security-driven bitcoin user. This is possible thanks to the microSD slot built into the side of the wallet — you can pass along transaction (and other) information to and from a computer by simply putting the chip into the computer and then back into the wallet. \nIn terms of security, the Mk3 uses Microchip's ATECC608A to store the critical master secret: the 24-word seed phrase for your BIP 32/BIP 39 wallet.",
