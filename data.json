Other notched bones are 80,000 years old but it is unclear if the notches are merely decorative or if they bear a functional meaning.[3]\n\nAccording to The Universal Book of Mathematics the Lebombo bone's 29 notches suggest \"it may have been used as a lunar phase counter, in which case African women may have been the first mathematicians, because keeping track of menstrual cycles requires a lunar calendar\". However, the bone is clearly broken at one end, so the 29 notches may or may not be the total number.
